<p> I caught my first Striped bass when I was 10 years old, it was life changing. From that moment on, I was "hooked" on targeting the Striped Bass. I would literally lay awake at night thinking about "the one that got away" or what might be a good spot to target these cool fish. Little did I know this hobby of mine was going to turn into an addiction and even a job. It became more about how can I could find the biggest and the most Striped Bass in my area. I love to show the people of Swampscott what could be swimming right under their feet. I fish for these Striped Bass commercially as well as Bluefish and tuna. The Bluefish usually come in late summer/early fall and are pound for pound one of the strongest fish in the ocean. Bluefish are peoples favorite to catch because of there agressive hits and there powerful fights. Tuna come in mid/late summer depending on the water temp and amount of bait in the area. They are easily one of the fastest fish in the ocean... They have a unique bullet shaped body that allows them to hit speed over 40mph. With this speed comes some problems.... the Bluefin Tuna is one of the toughest fish to land because of lack of tension on the line. The Winter Flounder, Tog, and Cod are usually an early spring/late fall targeted fish and are bottom dwellers. And the markerel are bait fish that many species forage on(many are mentioned above). These fish are mainly targeted for live bait for fisherman to catch bigger species(like the Striped Bass for instance). </p>
