<p> The boat is a 22 foot Novi made in Novascotia, Canada. The boat is center console, meaning the helm or wheel is located in the middle of the boat. This design is great for fishing because it allows us to have lots of room from the bow of the boat to the stern. This ultimately allows us plenty of area to cast, move around, and store fish. The boat is equipped with a 60hp Susiki engine that gets us where we need to go(cruises at about 10-12 knots). The boat is also equipped with Raymarine fishfinder and GPS for locating fish and navigating. Over all this a great boat for what we do; commercially and recreationally fishing. </p>
