<H2>Lures or Live Bait </H2>

<p> Lures or live bait? It's a great question that depending on who you talk to will vary. Many fisherman will say live bait because it's the most effective way because you are feeding the fish it's natural forage. It's also of course the most life-like(well because its actually alive). While live bait is effective, I prefer fishing artificial lures. First off, I like the the challenge of making something that's inanimate look real enough for a fish to think it's real and eat it. I have also been very successful with lures catching my biggest Striped Bass ever(45lbs and 48inches long). </p>
