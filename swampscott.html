<H1>Where I Fish</H1>
<H2>Swampscott, Massachusetts</H2>


<p> I grew up and lived in Swampscott, MA my whole life. It's a small coastal town just only 3 miles north of Boston, MA. The town was first settled as a part of Lynn, MA in 1629 and was later independently founded in 1852. Swampscott, being on the rich and plentiful water of the Atlantic, was first settled as fishing community. The harbor was full of lobster fishermen and fishermen who used tactics such as gillnetting. As over-fishing increased and times changed, the harbor became more and more empty of fishermen. Today, while the harbor hosts many boats, only about 10 are active commercial fisherman, the rest of the boats are used just recreational use. I am part of those 10 fishermen remaining. While the boat is kept in Swampscott harbor, my partner and I fish everywhere from just outside the harbor, to the rocky shoreline of Nahant, MA, to even as far north as Gloucester, MA. The water is plentiful with a variety of different fish species. Many of which can be sold on the commercial market. </p>
