<p>I caught my first fish when I was 8 and I've been "HOOKED" ever since. I've done everything from freshwater bass fishing to big game saltwater fishing for sharks and tuna. My mission is to get more people, especially youth, into sport fishing through sharing my crazy experiences and countless epic photos. So what are you waiting for? Your adventure starts here. </p>
